    <h2>Roasted Brocolli</h2>
    <h3>What is</h3>
    <p>Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowering head, stalk and small associated
        leaves are eaten as a vegetable. Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica
        oleracea. Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out
        from a thick stalk which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli
        resembles cauliflower, which is a different but closely related cultivar group of the same Brassica species.</p>
    <p>It can be eaten either raw or cooked. Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K.
        Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are
        diminished by boiling but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 ounces brocolli</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem
            pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
